# OpenDidac

OpenDidac is an open-source educational platform for creating and managing training exercises and exams, for a variety of disciplines including software engineering.

## Key Features

### A Variety of Question Types

OpenDidac offers various question types. In addition to standard formats like **multiple choice**, **true/false**, and **essay** questions, more specialized question types are available for software engineering:
 
- **Code Writing**: Given a code template, a rich editor lets students write code and run automated tests. Supported languages include JavaScript, Python, Java, C, C++, Golang, and more.
- **Code Reading**: Given a code snippet, students must predict its output.
- **Database**: Students complete SQL queries against a PostgreSQL database and validate results.
- **Web**: Students can write HTML, CSS and JavaScript code with live preview, to achieve specific goals.

### Powerful Management Tools for Professors

OpenDidac provides a simple yet complete interface for educators to manage the entire evaluation lifecycle:

- **Question Bank**: Create and organize questions by type, tags, and more.
- **Evaluation Composition**: Select questions from the bank with assigned points and coefficients.
- **Powerful Settings**: From long-lasting training mode with access to solutions, to strict exam mode with time limits and restricted access, create evaluations that suit your needs.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Track student progress and engagement during evaluations with detailed analytics.
- **Grading Tools**: Automated grading for code writing and database questions, with options for manual review, annotations, and feedback.
- **Results Management**: Export grades and detailed reports, provide feedback to students, and purge data as needed.
