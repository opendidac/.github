# OpenDidac

Welcome to **OpenDidac** – an open-source educational platform designed to revolutionize how training exercises and exams are created, distributed, and managed.

## 🎯 What is OpenDidac?

OpenDidac (also known as EVAL) is a comprehensive educational platform that enables educators to create engaging assessments and conduct exams across engineering and other disciplines. With a focus on ease of use and simplicity, OpenDidac provides a seamless experience for both educators and students.

- **Web**: CSS, HTML, and JavaScript challenges
- **Multiple Choice & True/False**: Traditional assessment formats
